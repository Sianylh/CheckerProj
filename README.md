 * This program connects to SSMS database and then queries it for a table with bindings.
 * Then the bindings are grouped by their names and a dropdown list is generated.
 * The user can select the dropdown list and run a group of bindings or run all of them.
 * The results of the execution are shown in the grid table.
 * There is a status bar at the bottom to show the connection status, success and failure.
